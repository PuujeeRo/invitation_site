-- LOCAL-DEV-ONLY Supabase shim for running the real app (not just the schema
-- suite) against a plain local PostgreSQL via a natively-run PostgREST, with no
-- Docker and no GoTrue (Supabase Auth has no Windows binary and there is no Go
-- toolchain here to build one). NOT for a real Supabase project -- Supabase
-- already provides all of this, correctly, itself.
--
-- Differs from supabase/testing/shim.sql (the throwaway schema-test harness) in
-- one important way: that harness runs every check as a Postgres superuser, so
-- RLS bypass and role-switching are never actually exercised. Here PostgREST
-- authenticates as this database's login role and does a real `SET ROLE` per
-- request based on the caller's JWT -- `service_role` must actually bypass RLS
-- (mirroring Supabase's own behavior) and the login role must actually be a
-- member of anon/authenticated/service_role for that SET ROLE to succeed.

-- Matches Supabase's actual auth.uid() (not a simplification of it): modern
-- PostgREST sets one request.jwt.claims JSON GUC per request rather than a
-- separate request.jwt.claim.<name> GUC per claim, which is what the fallback
-- below is for. Verified against a live PostgREST request that the per-claim
-- GUC this originally checked only is never actually set -- auth.uid() was
-- silently always NULL, so every RLS check involving it failed closed.
