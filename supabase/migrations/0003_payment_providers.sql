-- Adds Stripe as a payment provider alongside QPay.
--
-- 'mock' is added too so a dev-mode payment is recorded as what it actually was.
-- Previously the mock provider's payments were either left at the 'qpay' column
-- default or skipped, which made the payments table lie about how an event was
-- paid for.
--
-- Note: ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE is safe inside a migration transaction only as
-- long as the new value is not *used* in the same transaction, which is why this
-- migration only declares the values and does not insert any rows with them.
alter type payment_provider add value if not exists 'stripe';
alter type payment_provider add value if not exists 'mock';

-- Currency is no longer implicitly MNT: QPay bills in MNT, but a Stripe account
-- may be configured to charge in another currency (see STRIPE_CURRENCY), so the
-- payment row records which currency the amount is denominated in.
alter table public.payments
  add column if not exists currency text not null default 'MNT';
