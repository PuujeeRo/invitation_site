# Naashir

Create an animated event invitation in a few clicks, share the link on Messenger, and watch guest RSVPs come in on a live dashboard. See [docs/Naashir_Product_Plan_v1.md](docs/Naashir_Product_Plan_v1.md) for the full product plan (pricing, guest-limit rules, build order).

## Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4)
- **Supabase** — Postgres, Auth (magic link), Storage
- **QPay/SocialPay** and **Resend** — pluggable, behind provider interfaces (mocked/log-only until real credentials are set)

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in Supabase project keys
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**No hosted Supabase project yet?** See [supabase/localdev/README.md](supabase/localdev/README.md) — runs the whole app against your own local PostgreSQL with no Docker, using a natively-run PostgREST instead of a real Supabase project. Real RLS enforcement, not a shortcut; the one thing it can't do is real GoTrue (Supabase Auth has no Windows binary), so sign-in becomes a dev-only shortcut at `/dev-login` instead of magic-link email.

### Database

Schema lives in `supabase/migrations/`. Apply it against your Supabase project (via the SQL editor, or `supabase db push` with the Supabase CLI once linked).

- `0001_init.sql` — enums, `profiles`/`events`/`named_guests`/`rsvps`/`payments` tables, RLS policies, and the guest-limit trigger.
- `0002_storage.sql` — the `event-media` storage bucket + upload policies.

### Access model

- The **browser/anon** Supabase client is only used for organizer auth and the dashboard (RLS-scoped to `organizer_id = auth.uid()`).
- Everything guest-facing (public invite page, RSVP submit, named-guest link lookup, payment webhook, email send) goes through **server route handlers using the service-role key**, which bypasses RLS and enforces its own checks.
- The free-plan guest limit (10 or 100 depending on event type) is enforced by a **database trigger** on `rsvps`, not just app logic, so it can't be bypassed regardless of which key performs the insert.

## Project structure

```
src/
  app/            routes (App Router)
  components/     templates, RSVP widget, share buttons
  lib/            supabase clients, slug/greeting/template logic, plan limits
supabase/
  migrations/     SQL schema + RLS + storage policies

```

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev     # start dev server
npm run build   # production build (also type-checks)
npm run lint    # eslint
```

## Testing the database

The migrations and the guest-counting rule are the parts with no UI to eyeball,
so they are covered by a suite that runs against a local PostgreSQL:

```bash
cp .env.test.local.example .env.test.local   # set PGUSER / PGPASSWORD
npx tsx scripts/verify-db.ts
```

It creates a throwaway `naashir_test` database (never touching any other
database), applies `supabase/testing/shim.sql` plus every migration in order,
and then asserts the behaviour the app depends on — most importantly that **the
guest limit the app displays equals the limit the database enforces**, for every
event type. That check is not decorative: the two had already drifted apart once
for Kid's 1st Birthday, and reintroducing the drift makes the suite fail.

The role it connects as needs `LOGIN`, `CREATEDB` (for the throwaway database)
and `CREATEROLE` (for the temporary role used to exercise the RLS policies):

```sql
CREATE ROLE naashir_test WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '...' CREATEDB CREATEROLE;
```

`supabase/testing/shim.sql` is **test-only** and must never be applied to a real
Supabase project. It creates the objects Supabase supplies and plain Postgres
does not — `auth.users`, `auth.uid()`, the `storage` schema, and the `anon` /
`authenticated` / `service_role` roles — so the real migrations run *unmodified*
and are validated exactly as they will run in production.

> This validates the schema, not the app. `supabase-js` talks to Supabase's REST
> API rather than to Postgres directly, so running the app itself still requires
> a real Supabase project.

## Payments

Providers sit behind one interface (`src/lib/payments/`), selected by
`PAYMENT_PROVIDER` (`qpay` | `stripe` | `mock`) or auto-detected from whichever
credentials are present. With none set, the mock provider drives a local
checkout page so the whole flow works in dev.

| Provider | Notes |
|---|---|
| `qpay` | Primary, MNT. Callback is unauthenticated, so `/api/payments/qpay/webhook` re-checks the real status via QPay's API before marking anything paid. Not yet tested against a live merchant account. |
| `stripe` | Structure only, no account yet. Checkout Session + signature-verified webhook at `/api/payments/stripe/webhook`. |
| `mock` | Dev default. Exercises the real create → pay → confirm path via `/pay/mock/[paymentId]`. |

A pinned provider whose credentials are missing throws rather than falling back
to `mock` — a misconfigured deploy must fail loudly, not quietly give away free
upgrades.

```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-payments.ts   # currency conversion + provider selection
```

### Before using Stripe, check these

Stripe is wired up but **is not usable for the 999₮ per-event price**, for
reasons that are commercial rather than technical:

- **999₮ is below Stripe's minimum charge.** ~999₮ is roughly USD 0.28, under
  Stripe's ~USD 0.50 minimum, so the charge would be rejected outright.
- **Fees would exceed the payment.** At roughly 2.9% + USD 0.30, the fee alone
  is larger than the whole 999₮.
- **Mongolia is not a supported Stripe country.** Stripe accounts require a
  business in one of its supported countries, which does not include Mongolia —
  using it means incorporating elsewhere.
- **MNT as a Stripe presentment currency is unverified.** `STRIPE_CURRENCY`
  defaults to `MNT`, but confirm Stripe actually supports it for your account
  before relying on it; otherwise set a supported currency.

Where Stripe *does* fit: the Phase 2 **49,000₮/year business plan** in the
[product plan](docs/Naashir_Product_Plan_v1.md) (~USD 14, comfortably above the
minimum), or taking international card payments. QPay/SocialPay remain the right
rails for the core 999₮ Mongolian flow.

## Brand assets

| Asset | Use |
|---|---|
| [`src/components/brand/Logo.tsx`](src/components/brand/Logo.tsx) | In-app logo. `LogoMark` (icon only) and `Logo` (icon + wordmark). Uses `currentColor`, so it adapts to light/dark automatically — prefer this inside the app. |
| [`src/app/icon.svg`](src/app/icon.svg) | Favicon / app icon. Picked up automatically by the Next.js `app/icon.svg` convention. |
| [`public/logo-mark.svg`](public/logo-mark.svg) | Standalone monoline mark for use outside the app (README, docs). Fixed colors. |
| [`public/logo-tile.svg`](public/logo-tile.svg) | Solid gradient tile version, for where the logo needs its own background (social avatar, app icon). |

The mark echoes the invitation card's own visual language (the flap fold and the
four-point ornament), so brand and product read as one design. Rendered at
16–64px in [docs/screenshots/logo-sizes.png](docs/screenshots/logo-sizes.png).

> XML comment — it is illegal in XML and silently breaks the entire file with a
> parse error rather than just ignoring the comment.

## Design constraints

Guests almost always open invitations on a phone, from a Messenger link — the
public invitation page is mobile-first, and **280px (the Galaxy Fold's outer
screen) is the narrowest supported width**. Layout changes should be checked
there, not just at a comfortable phone size:

```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3002
npm install --no-save playwright && npx playwright install chromium  # first run only
node scripts/screenshots.js
```

That writes `docs/screenshots/` and **exits non-zero on any horizontal page
overflow** or console error, at 280px / 390px / desktop. Current reference
screenshots live in [docs/screenshots/](docs/screenshots/). `playwright` is
deliberately not a project dependency — it would add a large browser download
to every install for a tool only needed when checking layout.
